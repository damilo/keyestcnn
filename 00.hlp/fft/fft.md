#### Equal Temperament
<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament#General_properties'>Wikipedia: equal temperament</a>

In an equal temperament, the distance between two adjacent steps of the scale is the same interval.

$r^n=p$, $r=\sqrt[\uproot{2}n]{p}$ - ratio r divides the ratio p into n equal parts

#### 12-TET
In twelve-tone equal temperament (12-TET), an octave is divided into 12 equal parts, the width of a semitone.
The frequency ratio of the interval between two adjacent notes, is:

$r=\sqrt[\uproot{2}12]{2}$

To find the frequency, $P_n$, of a note in 12-TET, the following definition may be used:

$P_n = P_a (\sqrt[\uproot{2}12]{2})^{(n-a)}$

$P_n$ is the frequency of the pitch to find, $P_a$ is the frequency of a reference pitch, $n$ and $a$ refer to numbers from a list of consecutive integers assigned to consecutive semitones.

In musical analysis, material belonging to an equal temperament is often given an integer notation, meaning a single integer is used to represent each pitch.

#### Integer notation of pitches

Most modern pianos have a row of 88 black and white keys. This means that the piano can play 88 different pitches.

A list of the fundamental frequencies in hertz (cycles per second) of the keys of a modern 88-key standard piano in 12-TET, with the 49th key (A4), tuned to 440 Hz (A440).

Insted of taking the piano keys as integer notation, the Scientific Pitch Notation with some minor changes is used.

<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_pitch_notation'>Scientific pitch notation</a>

(or SPN, also known as American Standard Pitch Notation (ASPN) and International Pitch Notation (IPN)) is a method of specifying musical pitch by combining a musical note name (with accidental if needed) and a number identifying the pitch's octave.

A is always the basis, but notations begin with C.

$C_{-1}$ (note C of ocatve -1) will be the first pitch and noted with 0 as it is defined by MIDI.
From there we create a list of 128 pitch frequencies, up to $G_{9}$ (note G of octave 9, MIDI=128)

Then we are able to choose whatever range we want for further processing (whole range, 88-key Piano, 108-key Piano).

Note A is always the 9th note, and therefor the pitch ratios begin at -9 and end at 2.
